# Obsolescence

## Searching

If you search for 'mutt' on github, bitbucket, etc you will find >700
repositories.  There are a lot of people who thought that Mutt needed something
extra.

Most of the repos contain the same features, e.g. Sidebar, Index Color.
Unfortunately, each repo was created at a different time with a different
versino of the patch and occasionally different bug fixes.

Richard Russon ([FlatCap](https://github.com/flatcap)) examined all these repos
and determined what should be preserved.  The results are saved in the
[community repo](https://github.com/neomutt/community).

## Making Releases

Searching and categorising these repos took a lot of time.  It means that when a
NeoMutt release is made, we can categorically say: "This is the only version
you'll need".

Alternatively, "This NeoMutt version obsoletes this list of versions".
